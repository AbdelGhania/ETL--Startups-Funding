Extraction

I  used a dataset from  Kaggle


Transformation

First step in cleaning up the datasets involved figuring out which variables were not relevant.

Load

The last step was to transfer final output into a Database. I created a database and respective tables to match the columns from the final Pandaâ€™s Data Frame using PostGreSQL and then connected to the database using SQLAlchemy and loaded the result.
